# JSX-MPA

#### An old-school multi-page app with modern features

- JSX/TSX templating (no client-side React necessary!)
- Client bundles written in Typescript

#### With some conventions and helpers:

- File based routing
- Client javascript co-located with server routes
- Seamless script tags to inject client js
- Easy package management by exposing specific `node_modules` directories with client packages
